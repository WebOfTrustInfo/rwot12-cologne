# Closing Out RWOT12

Some final thoughts on the process of this week's work.

## Beyond DID:Web (Mirko)

Would not have gone as deep into the topic if it were remote or if it were just one day.

Have decided they need more time, but have already scheduled next meeting.

## Composing Self-Sovereign Identity for Web3 Applications (Collin)

After split of original group, required a lot of reframing.

Wrote some things at hotel room last night and continued through to today!

## The Ecosystem Coordinator’s role in SSI ecosystem management (Chris)

## Exchanges through NOSTR for DID Holders (Frederic)

Wants to see diagrams in papers, and didn't have time to do them! 

Even working in a group of two, still had other ideas thanks to conversation with other people! Small contributions are important!

## Leading with a Different Pitch: Data Portability, Rather Than Privacy (Ankur)

Process felt like jazz!

Didn't have title and writing until today! But got a lot of stuff in. That was aided by being deeply engaged in conversation for the last few days.

## Mind the Gap (Eric, Joe)

Tricky paper because it contains some topics that people have been wrestling at forever.

Got 80% of rough draft. Lots of paring down to do. Had an outline very early on, and that gave them guidance/focus and ability to split up group.

## Multibit Status List Tradeoffs (Joe)

A few talks on Signal, and fleshed out initial notes.

## Verifiable Presentation of Composed Credentials (Sebastian)

Chaotic process. Worked on use cases, then similarities and differences, then demos that showed process/workflow. The group was somewhat split among three use cases and also among what technologies they wanted to use. Ultimately decided to use a technology for the use cases.

The real advantage was getting to work face-to-face, not remotedly.
